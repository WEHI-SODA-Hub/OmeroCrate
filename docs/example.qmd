# Example

## Data

In this example we will use the Calcium Imaging data thanks to:

> Schröder, M., Staehlke, S., Groth, P., Nebe, J. B., Spors, S., & Krüger, F. (2022). Structure-based knowledge acquisition from electronic lab notebooks for research data provenance documentation. Journal of Biomedical Semantics, 13. https://doi.org/10.1186/s13326-021-00257-x

But you can use your own data instead.

## Basic Usage

First, we start by performing the installation [as described here](../README.md):

```bash
uv init
uv add git+https://github.com/WEHI-SODA-Hub/OmeroCrate
```

Next, we obtain a copy of the crate we want to upload:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SFB-ELAINE/Ca-imaging-RO-Crate.git
```

Then we authenticate:

```bash
export OMERO_PASSWORD=xxx
export OMERO_HOST=xxx
```
